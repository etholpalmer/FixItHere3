/// Memoised map *source object*, not just its HTML.
///
/// Caching the string was necessary and not sufficient: the view wrapped it in
/// `HtmlWebViewSource(Html = ...)`, constructing a brand-new object on every
/// render. With the 250 ms countdown pump that is four new sources a second,
/// and Fabulous re-sets a property whose value is a different reference — so
/// the WebView reloaded continuously and the map visibly flashed.
///
/// A reload also drops and re-opens the page's own SignalR connection, which is
/// why "no hub churn" was the wrong thing to measure: the page came back faster
/// than a dropped connection took to surface.
///
/// Handing back the same instance makes the diff a no-op. Keyed on what the map
/// actually depends on, so moving to a different job still rebuilds it.
